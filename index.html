    <!-- bismillah, bc there's no other way innit ;D i'm gonna try updating this to BS5, and alxamdulillaah I left myself a lot of time to do so. if i end up having a new template, it will probably come from this made in BS5, and obviously will include newer code. If I make a CMS (content management system) I'd have to upgrade BS relatively regularly but only if I wish. It shouldn't be too difficult though, once I get the hang of the CMS creation. -->
